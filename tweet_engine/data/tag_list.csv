Until recent years, shoes were not worn by most of the world's population.	I am holding my shoe. I may also be wearing it. The foot contains more bones than any other single part of the body.
Card 2	00009FEC77	thing	a book	I have picked up a book about Media Theory. I may read it now or replace it on my bookshelf. Media Theory is a subset of media studies.	I am reading an interesting book. I am very intellectual and informed. I am currently on page 257 of 512.	Having read this book several times, I believe I may now begin writing my own book in response. I am a highly creative individual.
Large Circle	03000DEB91	thing	a cup	I have a large cup or mug. I may or may not be drinking from it. The cup is a customary unit of measurement for volume.	I am holding a cup of coffee. The coffee is 27 minutes old and is currently at 86 degrees Fahrenheit. A small item is floating in it.	The liquid in the cup in my hand is shaking. At 56 minutes in Jurassic Park, a cup of water ripples as a T-Rex approaches.
Keyring	8400338518	thing	coffee	I am currently making a cup of Starbucks VIA coffee as enjoyed by over 1.2 million other PAUSE members. Via means by way of.	I seem to be making more coffee. My packet of Starbucks VIA instant coffee is now half empty. Starbucks began in 1971.	There is only so much coffee one man can drink in one day. Perhaps I have had too much? I am feeling somewhat excitable.

I have been playing Angry Birds for a prolonged period of time. I am 76 per cent of the way through the game. I am not on the leaderboard.	My phone is yet again in my hand. Am I beginning to form an unnatural bond with it. Perhaps we need some time apart?
